Question 1:
In graph_deepFirst the function analizes a graph by depth, so it is better to look for nodes deep inside the graph.
In graph_breadthFirst the function analizes the graph by width, making it better to find nodes that are not deep in the graph
pathFromTo is a function that can work with both of the previous functions beecause it is not relevant the way the node is found.
